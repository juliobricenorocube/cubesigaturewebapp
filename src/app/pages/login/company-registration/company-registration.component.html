  </p>

  <h6>4. Availability</h6>
  <p>

USER, HOWEVER, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL CUBE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, RESULTING FROM THE LAURIS ONLINE WEBSITE BEING UNACCESSIBLE FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME FOR ANY REASON.

  </p>

  <h6>5. Pricing</h6>
  <p>
  User agrees that the single (i.e., per seat) renewable license specified in Section 2, above, and under which User is operating the Software system, has a duration coterminous with the User’s subscription period.
  <br><br>

  User agrees that use of the Software system and the grant of the license specified in Section 2, above, is subject to the payment of any applicable licensing fees and costs.  CUBE reserves the right to immediately and without notice cancel this Agreement, as well as restrict or terminate access to the Software system in the event registration fee payments remain outstanding.  Similarly, in the event the license described in Section 2, above, is not renewed, CUBE reserves the right to terminate this Agreement, as well as restrict or terminate access to the Software system as of the date of the license’s expiration.  In the event access to the Software system is restricted for non-payment or non-renewal, User agrees to hold harmless and release CUBE from and against any and all claims, damages, costs, fees, expenses, loss of business or business interruption suffered by User as a result of the restriction of access.
  <br><br>
  Pricing is subject to change without notice; and CUBE reserves the right to adjust or modify any pricing, at anytime after the pricing change is made.  The full invoice amount is due prior to a user’s first use of the system, unless otherwise expressly indicated in a separate signed writing by CUBE.  If User defaults in any payment when due, then the whole invoice amount shall immediately become due and payable upon demand, or CUBE, at its option without prejudice to other lawful remedies, may defer delivery or cancel this contract.  Should User decide to terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Agreement’s term, CUBE may, but is not
   <br><br>
  obligated to, return a part of the invoiced amount.  User shall reimburse CUBE, upon demand, for any costs of collection incurred by CUBE, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

  </p>

  <h6>8. Data Privacy</h6>
  <p>

To the extent that this information constitutes

  personal data, CUBE shall be the controller of such personal data.

  <h6>9. Confidential Information and Protection Thereof</h6>
  <p>
  The following information shall be considered Confidential Information, whether or not marked or identified as such: (a) information regarding CUBE pricing, product roadmaps or strategic marketing plans; and (b) non-public materials relating to the User or the Software.

  CUBE may use Confidential Information (a) to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this EULA; or (b) in connection with the parties’ ongoing business relationship. CUBE will not use any Confidential Information of Discloser for any purpose not expressly permitted by this EULA, and will disclose the Confidential Information of Discloser only to the employees or contractors of CUBE who have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this EULA and who are under a duty of confidentiality no less restrictive than CUBE duty hereunder. Recipient will protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as CUBE protects its own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care.

  CUBE’s obligations under Section 9 with respect to any Confidential Information will terminate if CUBE can show by written records that such information: (a) was already known to CUBE at the time of disclosure by User; (b) was disclosed to CUBE by a third party who had the right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is, or through no fault of CUBE has become, generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by CUBE without access to, or use of, User’s Information. In addition, Recipient will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial or administrative body, provided that CUBE notifies User of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with User, at User’s request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.
  </p>

  <h6>10. Governing Law, Venue and Jurisdiction</h6>
  <p>

  In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof, the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement. To this effect, they shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be Miami, Florida.
  <br><br>

  Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim or counterclaim on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator, which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within 45 days following the appointment of the arbitrator.
   <br><br>

  The arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator, all of its costs and fees. “Costs and fees” mean all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators’ fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys’ fees. The arbitrator has no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute. Any award issued by the arbitrator shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law.
  <br><br>
  This agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The parties acknowledge that this agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the arbitration clause in this agreement.
